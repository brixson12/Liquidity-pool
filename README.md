Secure Personal Information Management Application
This Python application demonstrates a secure way to manage personal information using object-oriented programming concepts. 
It includes classes to represent personal information, manage operations on this information, and enforce access control using a secure application interface.

Features
PersonalInfo Class:
Represents a person's information (name, address, email, links).
Allows creation and representation of personal information objects.
PersonalInfoManager Class:
Manages operations (create, read, update, delete) on personal information.
Ensures that only one instance of personal information exists at a time.
SecureApp Class:
Provides a secure interface for accessing and managing personal information.
Controls access to personal information based on wallet addresses.
Usage
Setup
Ensure you have Python installed on your machine.
Install required dependencies (web3 library for blockchain interactions, if applicable).
Clone this repository to your local machine.
Running the Application
Navigate to the directory containing the Python script (secure_app.py).
Run the script using Python:
Copy code
python secure_app.py
Example Operations
Initialize a SecureApp instance with a specified wallet address.
Use the create_personal_info, read_personal_info, update_personal_info, and delete_personal_info methods to interact with personal information securely.
Integration with Blockchain (Optional)
To integrate with a blockchain platform (e.g., Ethereum), deploy a smart contract for storing personal information.
Update the SecureApp class to interact with the deployed smart contract using web3.py.
Security Considerations
Access Control:
Only authorized wallet addresses can perform operations on personal information.
Implement role-based access control (RBAC) if needed.
Data Privacy:
Encrypt sensitive personal information before storing it on the blockchain (if applicable).
